"Analysis": "<div style='font-family: Arial, sans-serif; max-width: 500px; white-space: pre-line; line-height: 1.5;'>In the first few episodes of *Breaking Bad*, the writers use language to stereotype the characters—especially Jesse Pinkman, who’s shown as a small-time meth dealer.\n\nIn this scene, Jesse and Walter show up at their first cook site. Jesse checks out the area to make sure it’s safe. He spots a cow house in the distance and figures they’re good to go.\n\n<span class='quote'><strong>Jesse:</strong> <em>\"Yeah, nothing but cows. Got some big cow house way out that way like two miles, but I don’t see nobody.\"</em>\n<strong>Walt:</strong> <em>\"Cow house?\"</em>\n<strong>Jesse:</strong> <em>\"Yeah. Where they live. The cows.\"</em>\n<strong>Walt:</strong> <em>\"Cow house…God help me.\"</em></span>\n\nWalt’s reaction to the phrase shows how he looks down on Jesse. It’s clear Walt starts to doubt teaming up with him just because of the way Jesse talks. By saying “cow house” instead of “barn,” Jesse comes off as someone who’s not well-educated. Add in the double negative (“I don’t see nobody”), and Jesse’s speech makes him sound uneducated and kind of clueless—feeding into the stereotype of a dropout turned drug dealer.</div>"

"Analysis": "<div style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;max-width:500px;line-height:1.5;white-space:pre-line;'>In this scene, Walter White is talking to Krazy8, his first drug-dealing opponent, who’s being held captive in Jesse Pinkman’s basement after trying to kill Walter in order to protect himself from the DEA. Although Walter doesn’t seem to react strongly to Krazy8’s language, this scene highlights a recurring pattern in *Breaking Bad*, where characters with Spanish-accented English tend to be Walter White’s enemies.<br><br>In this scene, you can hear Krazy8’s Spanish-accented pronunciation. For example, he often drops the /h/ sound: <span class='quote'>“You <strong>hope</strong> I’ll make it easy and just drop dead, don’t you?”</span> He also uses a light /l/ instead of the darker /l/: <span class='quote'>“Jesse <strong>told</strong> Emilio and me” (1:14)</span> <span class='quote'>“Not even <strong>close</strong>” (1:28)</span> <span class='quote'>“This <strong>line</strong> of work doesn’t suit you” (2:08)</span> He also rolls his final r’s: <span class='quote'><strong>Walter</strong> (2:00): “Your real problem is sitting <strong>upstairs</strong>” (2:33)</span> These small differences add up to his accent, making his English sound more Spanish. These speech patterns can lead people to make unconscious judgments about him. In *Breaking Bad*, by repeatedly linking accents to certain character types, the show reinforces the idea that non-standard English accents are connected with negative traits—specifically criminal activity, a low socioeconomic background, and a lack of professionalism.</div>"

This dialogue shows the social status differences between the two characters based on how they speak.<br><br>Skyler speaks very formally: <span class='quote'>“<strong>May</strong> I talk to you?”</span> When she hears Jesse’s more informal response – <span class='quote'>“Look lady, whatever you're selling, <strong>I ain't buying, yo</strong>”</span> – she starts copying his style, saying: <span class='quote'>“Well, my name is Skyler White, <strong>yo!</strong> My husband is Walter White, <strong>yo!</strong>”</span> In doing so, she mixes her own formal tone with Jesse’s informal speech to explain herself.<br><br>By using Jesse’s slang, the scene highlights the social divide between him and the White family, especially in terms of education and class. Skyler tries to show her superiority by using the word “<strong>marijuana</strong>” instead of “weed,” and by repeating Jesse’s slang with: <span class='quote'>“I can dig it – Okay, dig it, wonderful”</span><br><br>This scene is often seen as one of the funnier moments in the show, but it is crucial in establishing Jesse Pinkman’s character, especially in combination with Walter White’s reaction to Jesse’s vocabulary (see ‘First Cook Site’), which reflects the Whites’ impression of Jesse’s language, which informs their ideas about his education, social status, and class.</div>"

Being aware of how she can manipulate her appearance to play into the stereotype, Skyler changes both her appearance and manner of speech to be perceived as such. Her outfit – excessively extravagant and unfitting for the grim context of the IRS audit – combined with the way she modifies her speech allow her to be perceived as a dumb blonde. In terms of language, the following phrase particularly stands out:<br><br><span class='quote'>\"When I input everything into the Quicken, nothing flashes red, so that's <strong>gotta</strong> mean it's okay, <strong>right</strong>?\"</span><br><br>By using the informal version of 'got to' and not pronouncing the final /t/ sound in 'right', Skyler leans on the African American Vernacular English, which is stereotypically associated with low class and education. This, especially in the context of using Quicken for filing corporate taxes and the following answers to the questions (e.g.,<span class='quote'><i>How did you get this job? - Ted hired me</i></span>), convinces the IRS Officer in Skyler's negligence due to her incompetence.<br><br>To highlight the intentionality of Skyler's language and conduct, the following scene where she explains what she has just done in legal terms:<br><br><span class='quote'>\"What happened was good news. Ignorance of the law doesn't equate to criminality. It equates to ignorance.\"</span><br><br>By giving Skyler this persona, and changing her style of speech, the authors highlight her awareness of how she can be perceived, and what stereotypical linguistic features she can use to be perceived as a dumb blonde.</div>"

Even though Bogdan is supposed to be Romanian in the show (just as the actor is in real life), his name is not of Romanian origin, but rather Ukrainian or Polish. It appears that the authors chose the most Eastern European sounding name but did not put effort into authenticity.<br><br>Bogdan's English has a strong Eastern European accent, and his speech has grammatical features that native speakers of English may consider ungrammatical:<br><br><span class='quote'><em>\"I have work here for 30 years\"</em> – \"work\" instead of \"worked\"<br><em>\"You pull it from your behind?\"</em> – instead of \"Do you pull it out of your ass?\"</span><br>Bogdan's speech also makes him come across as a direct and rude person, which also plays into the stereotype of a crude Eastern European character. On top of this, this scene shows Bogdan's sexist ideas about Skyler being inferior to Walter, and just obeying his orders as his committed wife:<br><br><span class='quote'><em>\"But he [Walter] is not man enough to come in here and face me himself. Instead he sends his woman.\"</em></span><br>Skyler is taken aback by this sexist statement, which leads her to buy Bogdan's car wash at any cost to seek revenge both for herself and Walt.<br><br>By giving this sexist statement to Bogdan, authors create a revolting supporting character that also has linguistic features associated with foreignness – his name, accent, speech. Bogdan is one of the many characters who is antagonistic to Walter White, with his non-standard English being one of the signs of his antagonistic nature.</div>"

In trying to adapt to the new group of people, Hank talks to his colleague Vanko and makes a prejudiced statement about Mexican drug dealers combined with his attempt to mimic a Spanish-accented English:<br><br><span class='quote'>“...<strong>Scumbags</strong> kneeling down, praying to him: <em>please, Senor Saint, no DEA, please</em>”</span><br><br>His imitations of an exaggerated Spanish-accented English can be heard in adding word-initial Es (e.g.: he pronounces ‘please’ as <strong>‘e-please</strong>’), rolling Rs (e.g., <strong>Señor</strong>), pronouncing dyphthongs as monophtongs (e.g., “no” is pronounced as [no] instead of [noʊ]). His joke falls flat in the room, as opposed to Vanko’s phrase later in the scene spoken in (allegedly) fluent Spanish.<br><br>The contrast between the room’s reaction to Hank’s xenophobic joke in comparison to Vanko’s phrase shows the local prestige that Spanish has in this context. The difference arises from the people Hank had to interact with before getting a promotion. Before being promoted to El Paso, Hank worked with low-ranked drug dealers, who had low social status, with some of them being of Hispanic origin. This is why Hank associates Spanish with a lower status and makes fun of a Spanish-accented English, which he associates with low socioeconomic status and criminal activity. In the case of El Paso agents, they interact with high-ranking drug dealers, leaders of cartels. These people have high social status, and they are not immigrants, since they live in Mexico, which also strips them of a layer of social bias from white Americans. Knowing Spanish for them is a status of professionalism and responsibility, since they do not perceive Mexican drug dealers as “<strong>scumbags</strong>” but as “enemies”.<br><br>With this scene, authors use the concept of local prestige to make Hank feel like an outcast because of his raciolinguistic bias against Hispanic people, and, to some extent, start to revert the linguistic and racial biases about Latinx people that Hank has been reinforcing in the show.</div>"

By this moment, Jesse has created many compromising events and has threatened to snitch Walter to the DEA, which prompted Walter to hire a hitman for Jesse, and now he has to find Jesse’s location, which is why he visits Andrea – Jesse’s love interest in the second half of the show.<br>In this scene, Walter White tries to convince Andrea to call Jesse hoping that Jesse would not sense the trap and give away his whereabouts. Throughout the entire conversation, Andrea’s English does not sound Spanish-accented. Unlike Krazy8 (who you can read about in the Jesse’s Basement scene), Andrea pronounces /h/, does not roll her Rs, and pronounces dark Ls.<span class='quote'>“I have <em>his</em> card somewhere” (1:09)<br>“You<em>r</em> f<em>r</em>iend Walte<em>r</em> just d<em>r</em>opped by” (2:22)<br>“You’re <em>welcome</em> to stay a few minutes” (2:40)</span> The difference between her and Krazy8 do not just relate to their accents, but also to their social standing and role in the TV show: Andrea is a positive character, a single mom who is recovering from drug addiction and doing her best to improve her son’s future, while Krazy8 is a meth dealer who was willing to kill Walter White for his own advantage. <br> The combination of Andrea’s standard English accent reinforces the stereotype where positive characters tend to speak standardized English, while villains often have a foreign accent (e.g., Krazy8). The same applies to her child Brock, who is depicted as a monolingual English-speaking child with an English-sounding name, despite his ethnic background. <br>Therefore, when creating supporting characters, the authors of Breaking Bad rely on accent as a tool for signaling where the character is located in relation to the plot and Walter White on the positive/negative binary. Therefore, Breaking Bad perpetuates a stereotype where a non-English accent is associated with negative assumptions about a person, while an English accent is perceived as neutral or positive.</div>"

Gus Fring is an ambivalent character of the series. At first, he appears as powerful but benevolent, willing to hire Walter White as his private meth cook for three months and pay him 1 million dollars. However, as the show goes on, there arises a rivalry between Gus and Walter, with Gus eventually becoming Walt’s biggest enemy. This dynamic can be tracked through Gus’s English, which becomes more Spanish-accented when he presents himself as a danger to Walter White.<br> In the first scene of the video, where Gus is being interrogated by the police, we can notice that his English sounds very standard. In contrast to this, the following scene, where Gus meets Walt in the desert after Walt has incited the murder of several drug dealers, Gus’s pronounciation sounds more Spanish: <span class='quote'> “Medical condition” – light l instead of dark l <br> “Worthless junkie” – junkie vowel substitution /ʌ/ → /a/ or /o/ </span> He also tends to roll his Rs more when he is speaking from a position of danger – compare “he was a warm gentle person” from the first scene to “who couldn’t keep the peace for eight hours” from the second scene.<br> This correlation between his non-standard accented English and the context of the scene plays into a stereotypical representation of accents in media. According to this stereotype, villains tend to have non-standard English accents, while protagonists usually speak standard English. Considering the fact that the actor of the show speaks standard American English and he played many roles depicting various varieties/accents of English (African-American, Spanish, Italian), this detail may have been introduced either by the authors of the show or by the actor himself. Even a slight detail, this speech shift can subconsciously reinforce people’s negative associations with foreign-accented English (for similar cases, see Jesse’s Basement & Andrea’s New House).</div>"
