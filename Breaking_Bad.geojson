                "Analysis": "<div>In the first episodes of Breaking Bad, authors heavily relied on language use to stereotype characters, especially Jesse Pinkman, who is presented as a small-time meth dealer.\n\nIn this scene Jesse and Walter arrive at their first cook site, and Jesse is exploring the surroundings to make sure that they are in a safe location. In the scene, Jesse points out that there is only a cow house in sight, and therefore, they are safe.\n\n<strong>Jesse:</strong> <em>\"Yeah, nothing but cows. Got some big cow house way out that way like two miles, but I don’t see nobody.\"</em>\n<strong>Walt:</strong> <em>\"Cow house?\"</em>\n<strong>Jesse:</strong> <em>\"Yeah. Where they live. The cows.\"</em>\n<strong>Walt:</strong> <em>\"Cow house…God help me.\"</em>\n\nWalt’s strong reaction to the phrase reflects what social attitudes he has towards Jesse Pinkman based on his word choice. The phrase makes Walt question his decision to partner with Jesse in the meth business. The authors imply that by saying cow house Jesse is not aware of the word barn, which reflects his level of education. Coupled with a double negative (“I don’t see nobody”), Jesse’s grammar and word choice are associated with lower class and poor education, and stereotype him as a stupid college dropout drug dealer.</div>"

                "Analysis": "<p> This episode exemplifies the author's use of language to stereotype Jesse Pinkman as a college dropout drug dealer. </p> <p>This scene is a conversation between Jesse Pinkman and Skyler White (Walter White's wife). Skyler visits Jesse to warn him against selling weed to her husband. Jesse is trying to make Skyler leave his property (because she caught him in the midst of hiding a dead body), and when he is doing so, he leans into his informal language, which Skyler copies. </p> <p> In Skyler's monologue, when she is mimicking Jesse's style of speech and intonation, she balances this awkward and condescending demeanor in trying to explain herself. The immediate switch from her normal speech to her Jesse-esque speech shows how different the White family is from Jesse Pinkman in terms of education, background, and success. Seen as one of the comedic scenes of the series, this scene is formative in creating Jesse Pinkman's stereotypical character in the early seasons of the show. </p>"
