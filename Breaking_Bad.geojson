                "Analysis": "<div style='font-family: Arial, sans-serif; max-width: 650px; white-space: pre-line; line-height: 1.5;'>In the first episodes of Breaking Bad, authors heavily relied on language use to stereotype characters, especially Jesse Pinkman, who is presented as a small-time meth dealer.\n\nIn this scene Jesse and Walter arrive at their first cook site, and Jesse is exploring the surroundings to make sure that they are in a safe location. In the scene, Jesse points out that there is only a cow house in sight, and therefore, they are safe.\n\n<strong>Jesse:</strong> <em>\"Yeah, nothing but cows. Got some big cow house way out that way like two miles, but I don’t see nobody.\"</em>\n<strong>Walt:</strong> <em>\"Cow house?\"</em>\n<strong>Jesse:</strong> <em>\"Yeah. Where they live. The cows.\"</em>\n<strong>Walt:</strong> <em>\"Cow house…God help me.\"</em>\n\nWalt’s strong reaction to the phrase reflects what social attitudes he has towards Jesse Pinkman based on his word choice. The phrase makes Walt question his decision to partner with Jesse in the meth business. The authors imply that by saying cow house Jesse is not aware of the word barn, which reflects his level of education. Coupled with a double negative (“I don’t see nobody”), Jesse’s grammar and word choice are associated with lower class and poor education, and stereotype him as a stupid college dropout drug dealer.</div>"

This dialogue highlights the social status differences between the two characters through the language each one uses.<br><br>Skyler approaches Jesse using a very formal English: “<strong>May</strong> I talk to you?”<br>Upon hearing Jesse’s informal response – “Look lady, whatever you're selling, <strong>I ain't buying, yo</strong>” – she starts mimicking his sentence structure:<br>“Well, my name is Skyler White, <strong>yo!</strong> My husband is Walter White, <strong>yo!</strong>” – in doing so, she balances the awkwardly unfamiliar informal and condescending formal demeanors in trying to explain herself.<br><br>The integration of Jesse’s colloquialisms underscores the social difference between Jesse and the White family, in terms of education and class. Skyler emphasizes her superiority by using “<strong>marijuana</strong>” instead of “weed” and repeating Jesse’s use of slang in response to her: “I can dig it – Okay, dig it, wonderful”.<br><br>Seen as one of the comedic scenes of the series, this scene is formative in stereotyping Jesse Pinkman in the early seasons of the show, and it bears lots of similarities to the way Walter White reacts Jesse Pinkman’s vernacular (see ‘First Cook Site’ for more context).</div>"

                "Analysis": "<div style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;max-width:650px;line-height:1.5;white-space:pre-line;'>This scene shows Hank’s first day at the DEA office in El Paso – a city in Texas at the border with Mexico, which deals with high-profile cases of drug dealing. In trying to adapt to the new group of people, Hank talks to his colleague Vanko and makes a prejudiced statement about Mexican drug dealers combined with his attempt to mimic a Spanish-accented English:<br><br>“...<strong>Scumbags</strong> kneeling down, praying to him: <em>please, Senor Saint, no DEA, please</em>”<br><br>His joke falls flat in the room, as opposed to Vanko’s phrase later in the scene spoken in (allegedly) fluent Spanish.<br><br>The contrast between the room’s reaction to Hank’s xenophobic joke in comparison to Vanko’s phrase shows the local prestige that Spanish has in this context. The difference arises from the people Hank had to interact with before getting a promotion. Before being promoted to El Paso, Hank worked with low-ranked drug dealers, who had low social status, with some of them being of Hispanic origin. This is why Hank associates Spanish with a lower status and makes fun of a Spanish-accented English, which he associates with low socioeconomic status and criminal activity. In the case of El Paso agents, they interact with high-ranking drug dealers, leaders of cartels. These people have high social status, and they are not immigrants, since they live in Mexico, which also strips them of a layer of social bias from white Americans. Knowing Spanish for them is a status of professionalism and responsibility, since they do not perceive Mexican drug dealers as “<strong>scumbags</strong>” but as “enemies”.<br><br>With this scene, authors use the concept of local prestige to make Hank feel like an outcast because of his raciolinguistic bias against Hispanic people, and, to some extent, start to revert the linguistic and racial biases about Latinx people that Hank has been reinforcing in the show.</div>"
