"Analysis": "<div style='font-family: Arial, sans-serif; max-width: 500px; white-space: pre-line; line-height: 1.5;'>In the first few episodes of *Breaking Bad*, the writers use language to stereotype the characters—especially Jesse Pinkman, who’s shown as a small-time meth dealer.\n\nIn this scene, Jesse and Walter show up at their first cook site. Jesse checks out the area to make sure it’s safe. He spots a cow house in the distance and figures they’re good to go.\n\n<span class='quote'><strong>Jesse:</strong> <em>\"Yeah, nothing but cows. Got some big cow house way out that way like two miles, but I don’t see nobody.\"</em>\n<strong>Walt:</strong> <em>\"Cow house?\"</em>\n<strong>Jesse:</strong> <em>\"Yeah. Where they live. The cows.\"</em>\n<strong>Walt:</strong> <em>\"Cow house…God help me.\"</em></span>\n\nWalt’s reaction to the phrase shows how he looks down on Jesse. It’s clear Walt starts to doubt teaming up with him just because of the way Jesse talks. By saying “cow house” instead of “barn,” Jesse comes off as someone who’s not well-educated. Add in the double negative (“I don’t see nobody”), and Jesse’s speech makes him sound uneducated and kind of clueless—feeding into the stereotype of a dropout turned drug dealer.</div>"

"Analysis": "<div style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;max-width:500px;line-height:1.5;white-space:pre-line;'>In this scene, Walter White is talking to Krazy8, his first drug-dealing opponent, who’s being held captive in Jesse Pinkman’s basement after trying to kill Walter in order to protect himself from the DEA. Although Walter doesn’t seem to react strongly to Krazy8’s language, this scene highlights a recurring pattern in *Breaking Bad*, where characters with Spanish-accented English tend to be Walter White’s enemies.<br><br>In this scene, you can hear Krazy8’s Spanish-accented pronunciation. For example, he often drops the /h/ sound: <span class='quote'>“You <strong>hope</strong> I’ll make it easy and just drop dead, don’t you?”</span> He also uses a light /l/ instead of the darker /l/: <span class='quote'>“Jesse <strong>told</strong> Emilio and me” (1:14)</span> <span class='quote'>“Not even <strong>close</strong>” (1:28)</span> <span class='quote'>“This <strong>line</strong> of work doesn’t suit you” (2:08)</span> He also rolls his final r’s: <span class='quote'><strong>Walter</strong> (2:00): “Your real problem is sitting <strong>upstairs</strong>” (2:33)</span> These small differences add up to his accent, making his English sound more Spanish. These speech patterns can lead people to make unconscious judgments about him. In *Breaking Bad*, by repeatedly linking accents to certain character types, the show reinforces the idea that non-standard English accents are connected with negative traits—specifically criminal activity, a low socioeconomic background, and a lack of professionalism.</div>"

"Analysis": "<div style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;max-width:500px;line-height:1.5;white-space:pre-line;'>In this scene, Skyler White goes to Jesse Pinkman’s house to warn him about selling weed to her husband, Walter White. She’s acting on a lie Walter told her to cover up the drug business he’s getting into. This dialogue shows the social status differences between the two characters based on how they speak.<br><br>Skyler speaks very formally: <span class='quote'>“<strong>May</strong> I talk to you?”</span> When she hears Jesse’s more informal response – <span class='quote'>“Look lady, whatever you're selling, <strong>I ain't buying, yo</strong>”</span> – she starts copying his style, saying: <span class='quote'>“Well, my name is Skyler White, <strong>yo!</strong> My husband is Walter White, <strong>yo!</strong>”</span> In doing so, she mixes her own formal tone with Jesse’s informal speech to explain herself.<br><br>Skyler tries to show her superiority by using the word “<strong>marijuana</strong>” instead of “weed,” and by repeating Jesse’s slang with: <span class='quote'>“I can dig it – Okay, dig it, wonderful”</span><br><br>This scene is often seen as one of the funnier moments in the show, but it is crucial in establishing Jesse Pinkman’s character, especially in combination with Walter White’s reaction to Jesse’s vocabulary (see ‘First Cook Site’). The two scenes combined reflect the Whites’ impression of Jesse’s language, which informs their ideas about his education, social status, and class, and, therefore the way they treat him -- in both cases, condescendingly.</div>"

She understands how to use her appearance and speech to fit this stereotype, so she dresses too fancy for the situation and alters the way she speaks. Her extravagant outfit, which contrasts with the seriousness of the IRS audit, combined with her casual speech, makes her come across as a 'dumb blonde.' One line in particular stands out:<br><br><span class='quote'>\"When I input everything into the Quicken, nothing flashes red, so that's <strong>gotta</strong> mean it's okay, <strong>right</strong>?\"</span><br><br>Skyler uses the informal 'gotta' instead of 'got to' and drops the /t/ sound in 'right,' which resembles African American Vernacular English. This style of speech is often associated with lower class and education. Since she’s using Quicken for filing corporate taxes and answers questions like <span class='quote'>\"How did you get this job? – Ted hired me\"</span>, the IRS officer assumes she’s clueless and careless.<br><br>Later, Skyler explains what she’s done in a more professional tone:<br><br><span class='quote'>\"What happened was good news. Ignorance of the law doesn't equate to criminality. It equates to ignorance.\"</span><br><br>By changing her appearance and speech, the authors show that Skyler is fully aware of how others perceive her. They highlight how she manipulates these stereotypes to her advantage, playing into the 'dumb blonde' image, and her self-awareness subverts the stereotypical way she could be perceived.</div>"

Even though he’s supposed to be Romanian (and the actor Marius Stan is too), his name isn’t actually Romanian. It’s of Ukrainian or Polish origin, which suggests the authors went for a generic 'Eastern European' name without worrying too much about authenticity.<br><br>Bogdan speaks English with a strong Eastern European accent, and some of his grammar might sound off to native English speakers:<br><br><span class='quote'><em>'I have work here for 30 years'</em> (should be 'worked')<br><em>'You pull it from your behind?'</em> (should be 'pull it out of your ass?')</span><br><br>His directness and rudeness also feed into the stereotype of the crude Eastern European character. On top of that, in this scene, we see Bogdan’s sexist views, where he belittles Skyler by implying she’s just Walter’s obedient wife:<br><br><span class='quote'><em>'But he [Walter] is not man enough to come in here and face me himself. Instead he sends his woman.'</em></span><br><br>Skyler is shocked by this, which motivates her to buy Bogdan's car wash as a way of getting back at him and Walter.<br><br>By giving Bogdan these sexist views, along with his foreign-sounding name, accent, and speech, the authors create a character who is easy to dislike. His non-standard English highlights his antagonistic nature, which is common for other 'negative' characters of the show (see 'Jesse's Basement' and 'Somewhere in the Desert' for more).</div>"

                "Analysis": "<div style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;max-width:500px;line-height:1.5;white-space:pre-line;'>This scene shows Hank’s first day at the DEA office in El Paso – a city in Texas at the border with Mexico, which deals with high-profile cases of drug dealing. In trying to adapt to the new group of people, Hank talks to his colleague Vanko and makes a prejudiced statement about Mexican drug dealers combined with his attempt to mimic a Spanish-accented English:<br><br><span class='quote'>“...<strong>Scumbags</strong> kneeling down, praying to him: <em>please, Senor Saint, no DEA, please</em>”</span><br><br>His imitations of an exaggerated Spanish-accented English can be heard in adding word-initial Es (e.g.: he pronounces ‘please’ as <strong>‘e-please</strong>’), rolling Rs (e.g., <strong>Señor</strong>), pronouncing dyphthongs as monophtongs (e.g., “no” is pronounced as [no] instead of [noʊ]). His joke falls flat in the room, as opposed to Vanko’s phrase later in the scene spoken in (allegedly) fluent Spanish.<br><br>The contrast between the room’s reaction to Hank’s xenophobic joke in comparison to Vanko’s phrase shows the local prestige that Spanish has in this context. The difference arises from the people Hank had to interact with before getting a promotion. Before being promoted to El Paso, Hank worked with low-ranked drug dealers, who had low social status, with some of them being of Hispanic origin. This is why Hank associates Spanish with a lower status and makes fun of a Spanish-accented English, which he associates with low socioeconomic status and criminal activity. In the case of El Paso agents, they interact with high-ranking drug dealers, leaders of cartels. These people have high social status, and they are not immigrants, since they live in Mexico, which also strips them of a layer of social bias from white Americans. Knowing Spanish for them is a status of professionalism and responsibility, since they do not perceive Mexican drug dealers as “<strong>scumbags</strong>” but as “enemies”.<br><br>With this scene, authors use the concept of local prestige to make Hank feel like an outcast because of his raciolinguistic bias against Hispanic people, and, to some extent, start to revert the linguistic and racial biases about Latinx people that Hank has been reinforcing in the show.</div>"

By this moment, Jesse has created many compromising events and has threatened to snitch Walter to the DEA, which prompted Walter to hire a hitman for Jesse, and now he has to find Jesse’s location, which is why he visits Andrea – Jesse’s love interest in the second half of the show.<br>In this scene, Walter White tries to convince Andrea to call Jesse hoping that Jesse would not sense the trap and give away his whereabouts. Throughout the entire conversation, Andrea’s English does not sound Spanish-accented. Unlike Krazy8 (who you can read about in the Jesse’s Basement scene), Andrea pronounces /h/, does not roll her Rs, and pronounces dark Ls.<span class='quote'>“I have <em>his</em> card somewhere” (1:09)<br>“You<em>r</em> f<em>r</em>iend Walte<em>r</em> just d<em>r</em>opped by” (2:22)<br>“You’re <em>welcome</em> to stay a few minutes” (2:40)</span> The difference between her and Krazy8 do not just relate to their accents, but also to their social standing and role in the TV show: Andrea is a positive character, a single mom who is recovering from drug addiction and doing her best to improve her son’s future, while Krazy8 is a meth dealer who was willing to kill Walter White for his own advantage. <br> The combination of Andrea’s standard English accent reinforces the stereotype where positive characters tend to speak standardized English, while villains often have a foreign accent (e.g., Krazy8). The same applies to her child Brock, who is depicted as a monolingual English-speaking child with an English-sounding name, despite his ethnic background. <br>Therefore, when creating supporting characters, the authors of Breaking Bad rely on accent as a tool for signaling where the character is located in relation to the plot and Walter White on the positive/negative binary. Therefore, Breaking Bad perpetuates a stereotype where a non-English accent is associated with negative assumptions about a person, while an English accent is perceived as neutral or positive.</div>"

Gus Fring is an ambivalent character of the series. At first, he appears as powerful but benevolent, willing to hire Walter White as his private meth cook for three months and pay him 1 million dollars. However, as the show goes on, there arises a rivalry between Gus and Walter, with Gus eventually becoming Walt’s biggest enemy. This dynamic can be tracked through Gus’s English, which becomes more Spanish-accented when he presents himself as a danger to Walter White.<br> In the first scene of the video, where Gus is being interrogated by the police, we can notice that his English sounds very standard. In contrast to this, the following scene, where Gus meets Walt in the desert after Walt has incited the murder of several drug dealers, Gus’s pronounciation sounds more Spanish: <span class='quote'> “Medical condition” – light l instead of dark l <br> “Worthless junkie” – junkie vowel substitution /ʌ/ → /a/ or /o/ </span> He also tends to roll his Rs more when he is speaking from a position of danger – compare “he was a warm gentle person” from the first scene to “who couldn’t keep the peace for eight hours” from the second scene.<br> This correlation between his non-standard accented English and the context of the scene plays into a stereotypical representation of accents in media. According to this stereotype, villains tend to have non-standard English accents, while protagonists usually speak standard English. Considering the fact that the actor of the show speaks standard American English and he played many roles depicting various varieties/accents of English (African-American, Spanish, Italian), this detail may have been introduced either by the authors of the show or by the actor himself. Even a slight detail, this speech shift can subconsciously reinforce people’s negative associations with foreign-accented English (for similar cases, see Jesse’s Basement & Andrea’s New House).</div>"
