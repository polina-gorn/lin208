In the scene, Jesse points out that there is only a cow house in sight, and therefore, they are safe.\n\n<span class='quote'><strong>Jesse:</strong> <em>\"Yeah, nothing but cows. Got some big cow house way out that way like two miles, but I don’t see nobody.\"</em>\n<strong>Walt:</strong> <em>\"Cow house?\"</em>\n<strong>Jesse:</strong> <em>\"Yeah. Where they live. The cows.\"</em>\n<strong>Walt:</strong> <em>\"Cow house…God help me.\"</em></span>\n\nWalt’s strong reaction to the phrase reflects what social attitudes he has towards Jesse Pinkman based on his word choice. The phrase makes Walt question his decision to partner with Jesse in the meth business. The authors imply that by saying cow house Jesse is not aware of the word barn, which reflects his level of education. Coupled with a double negative (“I don’t see nobody”), Jesse’s grammar and word choice are associated with lower class and poor education, and stereotype him as a stupid college dropout drug dealer.</div>"

                "Analysis": "<div style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;max-width:500px;line-height:1.5;white-space:pre-line;'>In this scene, Walter White talks to Krazy8 – his first drug dealing opponent, who is held captive in Jesse Pinkman’s basement after trying to kill Walter White to protect himself from the DEA. Even though there is nothing prominent about Walter White’s reactions to Krazy8’s language, this scene exemplifies the accented narrative of Breaking Bad, where characters with Spanish-accented English happen to be Walter White’s enemies. <br><br>SIn this scene, we can hear Krazy8’s Spanish-accented pronunciation. For instance, he frequently omits the /h/ sound:  <span class='quote'>“You <strong>hope</strong> I’ll make it easy and just drop dead, don’t you?”</span>He also pronounces light /l/ instead of dark /l/: <span class='quote'> “Jesse <strong>told</strong> Emilio and me” (1:14) “Not even <strong>close</strong>” (1.28) “This <strong>line</strong> of work doesn’t suit you” (2:08) </span> He tends to trill or roll his final r’s<span class='quote'><strong>Walter</strong> (2:00) “Your real problem is sitting <strong>upstairs</strong>” (2:33)”</span> These seemingly minor differences comprise his accent and make his English Spanish-sounding, which leads people to make involuntary associations about the person. In the context of the show, by consistently connecting accents to the character archetypes, the authors reinforce the idea that non-standard English accents are associated with negative attributes. In this case – associated with criminal activity, low socioeconomic background, and lack of professionalism (which is somewhat reverted with Walter White’s main opponent – Gustavo Fring: see Gus’ Chicken Farm).</div>"

Being aware of how she can manipulate her appearance to play into the stereotype, Skyler changes both her appearance and manner of speech to be perceived as such. Her outfit – excessively extravagant and unfitting for the grim context of the IRS audit – combined with the way she modifies her speech allow her to be perceived as a dumb blonde. In terms of language, the following phrase particularly stands out:<br><br><span class='quote'>\"When I input everything into the Quicken, nothing flashes red, so that's <strong>gotta</strong> mean it's okay, <strong>right</strong>?\"</span><br><br>By using the informal version of 'got to' and not pronouncing the final /t/ sound in 'right', Skyler leans on the African American Vernacular English, which is stereotypically associated with low class and education. This, especially in the context of using Quicken for filing corporate taxes and the following answers to the questions (e.g.,<span class='quote'><i>How did you get this job? - Ted hired me</i></span>), convinces the IRS Officer in Skyler's negligence due to her incompetence.<br><br>To highlight the intentionality of Skyler's language and conduct, the following scene where she explains what she has just done in legal terms:<br><br><span class='quote'>\"What happened was good news.

Even though Bogdan is supposed to be Romanian in the show (just as the actor is in real life), his name is not of Romanian origin, but rather Ukrainian or Polish. It appears that the authors chose the most Eastern European sounding name but did not put effort into authenticity.<br><br>Bogdan's English has a strong Eastern European accent, and his speech has grammatical features that native speakers of English may consider ungrammatical:<br><br><span class='quote'><em>\"I have work here for 30 years\"</em> – \"work\" instead of \"worked\"<br><em>\"You pull it from your behind?\"</em> – instead of \"Do you pull it out of your ass?\"</span><br>Bogdan's speech also makes him come across as a direct and rude person, which also plays into the stereotype of a crude Eastern European character. On top of this, this scene shows Bogdan's sexist ideas about Skyler being inferior to Walter, and just obeying his orders as his committed wife:<br><br><span class='quote'><em>\"But he [Walter] is not man enough to come in here and face me himself. Instead he sends his woman.\"</em></span><br>Skyler is taken aback by this sexist statement, which leads her to buy Bogdan's car wash at any cost to seek revenge both for herself and Walt.<br><br>By giving this sexist statement to Bogdan, authors create a revolting supporting character that also has linguistic features associated with foreignness – his name, accent, speech.

   "Analysis": "<div style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;max-width:500px;line-height:1.5;white-space:pre-line;'>This scene shows Hank’s first day at the DEA office in El Paso – a city in Texas at the border with Mexico, which deals with high-profile cases of drug dealing. In trying to adapt to the new group of people, Hank talks to his colleague Vanko and makes a prejudiced statement about Mexican drug dealers combined with his attempt to mimic a Spanish-accented English:<br><br><span class='quote'>“...<strong>Scumbags</strong> kneeling down, praying to him: <em>please, Senor Saint, no DEA, please</em>”</span><br><br>His imitations of an exaggerated Spanish-accented English can be heard in adding word-initial Es (e.g.: he pronounces ‘please’ as <strong>‘e-please</strong>’), rolling Rs (e.g., <strong>Señor</strong>), pronouncing dyphthongs as monophtongs (e.g., “no” is pronounced as [no] instead of [noʊ]). His joke falls flat in the room, as opposed to Vanko’s phrase later in the scene spoken in (allegedly) fluent Spanish.<br><br>The contrast between the room’s reaction to Hank’s xenophobic joke in comparison to Vanko’s phrase shows the local prestige that Spanish has in this context. The difference arises from the people Hank had to interact with before getting a promotion. Before being promoted to El Paso, Hank worked with low-ranked drug dealers, who had low social status, with some of them being of Hispanic origin. This is why Hank associates Spanish with a lower status and makes fun of a Spanish-accented English, which he associates with low socioeconomic status and criminal activity. In the case of El Paso agents, they interact with high-ranking drug dealers, leaders of cartels. These people have high social status, and they are not immigrants, since they live in Mexico, which also strips them of a layer of social bias from white Americans. Knowing Spanish for them is a status of professionalism and responsibility, since they do not perceive Mexican drug dealers as “<strong>scumbags</strong>” but as “enemies”.<br><br>With this scene, authors use the concept of local prestige to make Hank feel like an outcast because of his raciolinguistic bias against Hispanic people, and, to some extent, start to revert the linguistic and racial biases about Latinx people that Hank has been reinforcing in the show.</div>"            },

The same applies to her child Brock, who is depicted as a monolingual English-speaking child with an English-sounding name, despite his ethnic background. <br>There are very few instances which point out Andrea’s Hispanic background. Omitting her ethnicity through the plot and her accent brings her closer to the White protagonists of the show, as opposed to the characters with stronger Spanish-accented English, who also happen to be Walter White’s antagonists. Therefore, when creating supporting characters, the authors of Breaking Bad rely on accent as a tool for signaling where the character is located in relation to the plot and Walter White on the positive/negative binary.<br>The authors of the show create a positive-negative binary, where a non-standard English accent prompts the audience to associate those characters with Walter White’s enemies.
