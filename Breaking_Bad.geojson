                "Analysis": "<div style='font-family: Arial, sans-serif; max-width: 650px; white-space: pre-line; line-height: 1.5;'>In the first episodes of Breaking Bad, authors heavily relied on language use to stereotype characters, especially Jesse Pinkman, who is presented as a small-time meth dealer.\n\nIn this scene Jesse and Walter arrive at their first cook site, and Jesse is exploring the surroundings to make sure that they are in a safe location. In the scene, Jesse points out that there is only a cow house in sight, and therefore, they are safe.\n\n<strong>Jesse:</strong> <em>\"Yeah, nothing but cows. Got some big cow house way out that way like two miles, but I don’t see nobody.\"</em>\n<strong>Walt:</strong> <em>\"Cow house?\"</em>\n<strong>Jesse:</strong> <em>\"Yeah. Where they live. The cows.\"</em>\n<strong>Walt:</strong> <em>\"Cow house…God help me.\"</em>\n\nWalt’s strong reaction to the phrase reflects what social attitudes he has towards Jesse Pinkman based on his word choice. The phrase makes Walt question his decision to partner with Jesse in the meth business. The authors imply that by saying cow house Jesse is not aware of the word barn, which reflects his level of education. Coupled with a double negative (“I don’t see nobody”), Jesse’s grammar and word choice are associated with lower class and poor education, and stereotype him as a stupid college dropout drug dealer.</div>"

"Analysis": "<div style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;max-width:650px;line-height:1.5;white-space:pre-line;'>In this scene, Walter White talks to Krazy8 – his first drug dealing opponent, who is being held captive in Jesse Pinkman’s basement. Even though there is nothing prominent about Walter White’s reactions to Krazy8’s language, this scene exemplifies the accented narrative of Breaking Bad, where characters with Spanish-accented English happen to be Walter White’s enemies. By consistently connecting accents to the character archetypes, the authors reinforce the idea that non-standard English accents are associated with negative attributes. In this case – associated with criminal activity, low socioeconomic background, and lack of professionalism (which is somewhat reverted with Walter White’s main opponent – Gustavo Fring: see <a href='#' class='geo-link' data-feature-id='Gus’ Chicken Farm'>Gus’ Chicken Farm</a>).</div>"            },

This dialogue highlights the social status differences between the two characters through the language each one uses.<br><br>Skyler approaches Jesse using a very formal English: “<strong>May</strong> I talk to you?”<br>Upon hearing Jesse’s informal response – “Look lady, whatever you're selling, <strong>I ain't buying, yo</strong>” – she starts mimicking his sentence structure:<br>“Well, my name is Skyler White, <strong>yo!</strong> My husband is Walter White, <strong>yo!</strong>” – in doing so, she balances the awkwardly unfamiliar informal and condescending formal demeanors in trying to explain herself.<br><br>The integration of Jesse’s colloquialisms underscores the social difference between Jesse and the White family, in terms of education and class. Skyler emphasizes her superiority by using “<strong>marijuana</strong>” instead of “weed” and repeating Jesse’s use of slang in response to her: “I can dig it – Okay, dig it, wonderful”.<br><br>Seen as one of the comedic scenes of the series, this scene is formative in stereotyping Jesse Pinkman in the early seasons of the show, and it bears lots of similarities to the way Walter White reacts Jesse Pinkman’s vernacular (see ‘First Cook Site’ for more context).</div>"

Being aware of how she can manipulate her appearance to play into the stereotype, Skyler changes both her appearance and manner of speech to be perceived as such. Her outfit – excessively extravagant and unfitting for the grim context of the IRS audit – combined with the way she modifies her speech allow her to be perceived as a dumb blonde. In terms of language, the following phrase particularly stands out:<br><br>\"When I input everything into the Quicken, nothing flashes red, so that's <strong>gotta</strong> mean it's okay, <strong>right</strong>?\"<br><br>By using the informal version of 'got to' and not pronouncing the final /t/ sound in 'right', Skyler leans on the African American Vernacular English, which is stereotypically associated with low class and education. This, especially in the context of using Quicken for filing corporate taxes and the following answers to the questions (e.g., <i>How did you get this job? - Ted hired me</i>), convinces the IRS Officer in Skyler's negligence due to her incompetence.<br><br>To highlight the intentionality of Skyler's language and conduct, the following scene where she explains what she has just done in legal terms:<br><br>\"What happened was good news. Ignorance of the law doesn't equate to criminality. It equates to ignorance.\"<br><br>By giving Skyler this persona, and changing her style of speech, the authors highlight her awareness of how she can be perceived, and what stereotypical linguistic features she can use to be perceived as a dumb blonde.</div>"

                "Analysis": "<div style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;max-width:650px;line-height:1.5;white-space:pre-line;'>This scene shows Hank’s first day at the DEA office in El Paso – a city in Texas at the border with Mexico, which deals with high-profile cases of drug dealing. In trying to adapt to the new group of people, Hank talks to his colleague Vanko and makes a prejudiced statement about Mexican drug dealers combined with his attempt to mimic a Spanish-accented English:<br><br>“...<strong>Scumbags</strong> kneeling down, praying to him: <em>please, Senor Saint, no DEA, please</em>”<br><br>His joke falls flat in the room, as opposed to Vanko’s phrase later in the scene spoken in (allegedly) fluent Spanish.<br><br>The contrast between the room’s reaction to Hank’s xenophobic joke in comparison to Vanko’s phrase shows the local prestige that Spanish has in this context. The difference arises from the people Hank had to interact with before getting a promotion. Before being promoted to El Paso, Hank worked with low-ranked drug dealers, who had low social status, with some of them being of Hispanic origin. This is why Hank associates Spanish with a lower status and makes fun of a Spanish-accented English, which he associates with low socioeconomic status and criminal activity. In the case of El Paso agents, they interact with high-ranking drug dealers, leaders of cartels. These people have high social status, and they are not immigrants, since they live in Mexico, which also strips them of a layer of social bias from white Americans. Knowing Spanish for them is a status of professionalism and responsibility, since they do not perceive Mexican drug dealers as “<strong>scumbags</strong>” but as “enemies”.<br><br>With this scene, authors use the concept of local prestige to make Hank feel like an outcast because of his raciolinguistic bias against Hispanic people, and, to some extent, start to revert the linguistic and racial biases about Latinx people that Hank has been reinforcing in the show.</div>"
